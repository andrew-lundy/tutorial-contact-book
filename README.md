# simple-contacts-tutorial
The source code for a set of tutorial videos I did on a few iOS development concepts. 

In this tutorial I will teach you how to use TableViews, pass data with segues and build modals that you can use in your applications. 

We will be building a simple contact application that demonstrates passing local data back and forth with the ability to edit the data within the app.
